This is a simple ecommerce website project that I've built that showcases some basic functionalities such as a navigation bar, a hero banner, a product listing section, and a footer section.

The navigation bar consists of a non-interactive menu button, a brand logo, and an interactive shopping cart button which displays the number of items added into the cart, and when clicked, displays a slide out section which displays all the added items and also offers interactive buttons that enables its users to either increase or decrease an item's quantity, remove an item, and clear all items in cart altogether with a 'Clear Cart' button. Additionally the shopping cart also displays the total price of all the items added into the cart. 

This website is linked to a CMS site called Contentful via API. Contenful allows users to add or remove products easily through their platform without the need to perform any changes to the original coding structure of the website.
